Unfortunately, it costs 150 Resonance Energy - that combined with Jinshi's incredibly fast and frequent rotations means you won't be gaining access to this ultimate every single rotation even with obscene amounts of Energy Regeneration. Instead of every rotation, it's best to aim for an ultimate cast every second rotation in most cases. How much energy regen you'll need in order to achieve this varies from team to team and also how you play that team. Pairing Jinhsi with teammates who spend more time on the field or generate more energy of their own will reduce her requirements with the opposite causing her to need more. As a general guide you can expect to need anywhere between 0 - 35% Energy Regen but erring on the higher side will ensure it. Teammates like Yuanwu who use minimal field time will require more whereas teammates like Yinlin who use more will require less."
